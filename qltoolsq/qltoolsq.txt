qltools 2.7q is qltools 2.7 modified for use with QLAY/QLAYW.

Copyright notice and qltools 2.7 manual are in the source
directory. The source code for qltools is in there as well.

All functions of qltools 2.7 are preserved. One new option
is added: -q . All files on a QL floppy can be retrieved
and stored on a PC directory. And a 'qlay.dir' file is created.



	How to use qltools 2.7q for QLAY?

1. Download the qltoolsq.zip file
2. Unzip the archive in a directory.
3. Place a QL floppy in PC a: drive (or b: drive).
4. Open a DOS box and type command:
     qltools a: -d
   This show the files contained on the QL floppy.
5. Type command:
     qltools a: -q
   This copies all files on the QL floppy to PC directory.
6. Remove floppy from PC a: (or b:) drive
7. Start your QLAY version
8. Type inside QLAY:
     dir win1_
   If all went well, the files from your floppy are now listed.



	Tips.

Many QL programs on floppy assume they are on FLP1_. To use such
programs unmodified, type the following command in QLAY:
     win_use flp

All next commands are on flp1_. For example:
     dir flp1_

Or to start a SuperBasic boot program, as on a QL with FLP:
     lrun flp1_boot

Files from multiple QL floppies can be copied to the same PC
directory. Files are appended in the 'qlay.dir'.

QLAYT is another QLAY support program. This allows add, delete
or update of the list of files on your PC that QLAY accesses.
