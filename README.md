# qlay
QLAY Sinclair QL emulator from Jan Venema.

This is a Windows-only port. There are makefiles for DevCpp TDM-GCC-64, Borland C++ 5.5, Embarcadero C++ 7.30
and Visual C++ 14.

Changes:
- throttling to set the exact speed of the emulator
- basic sound support on Windows
- optional config file on command line

**NOTE**: Don't forget you can use [QPC2](https://www.kilgus.net/qpc/), [Q-emuLator](https://www.terdina.net/ql/q-emulator.html), [SMSQmulator](https://www.wlenerz.com/smsqmulator/) or [sQLux](https://github.com/SinclairQL/sQLux).
Good luck!
