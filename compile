How to compile QLAY/QLAYW ?

Pick your compiler to get a proper makefile.
makefile.dos	DJGPP makefile for QLAY
makefile.w32	RSXNTDJ makefile for QLAYW
makefile.cyg	Cygnus makefile for QLAYW


Compiler versions ?

I succesfully compiled QLAY using these versions of
the various compilers, downloadable for free.

QLAY is developed with free software tools. You're encoraged
to enhance QLAY and improve compatibility with the original
QL hardware. If you do so, please make sure that the code
